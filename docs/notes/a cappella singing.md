Non-instrumental congregational singing—especially with four-part harmony—is a powerful demonstration of the priesthood of all believers, and of the unity in plurality that Paul defines as the nature of the Body of Christ.

- It brings together multiple parts, viscerally constituting a greater and more beautiful whole.    
- It draws on everyone to participate.
- It teaches everyone how to worship in the most minimalistic or mundane of settings—such as in a jail cell (Acts 16:25), in the remote wilderness, or in everyday life.

It is thus a gift, that extends far beyond the walls of the building, and fills up all the nooks and crannies of life.

There are many other gifts, of course. And beautiful and worshipful music of all kinds. But this is one that is worth valuing.
