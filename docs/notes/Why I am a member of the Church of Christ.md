1. Governance. Our structure is Congregational and Presbyterian. Decentralization with accountability is incredibly important in our time.
2. Human agency. Our sense of human nature and agency is more akin to Catholicism, Orthodoxy, and Anglicanism than to many forms of low-church Protestantism.
3. Baptism. We practice sacramental believerâ€™s baptism.
4. Open Communion. Open Communion is a powerful expression of freedom and generosity.
5. Singing. Congregational [[a cappella singing]] is a powerful expression of the priesthood of all believers.
6. Tradition. Retrieving and revitalizing that which has been handed to us, is a powerful way to help coming generations learn to retrieve and revitalize what has been handed to them.
7. Science & Religion. The Stone-Campbell Movement has always been closely connected to the roots of modern science. Reconciling science and religion is one of the primary tasks of our future.
