### Christian Transhumanist Community
Christian Transhumanism is an ecumenical community, in keeping with its engagement with a wide variety of both secular and religious thought. People in the Christian Transhumanist community come from all backgrounds and religious traditions. A large number of contemporary Christian Transhumanists are influenced by:

### Contemporary influences on Christian Transhumanists:
- NT Wright (on the religious side; see, for example, [Surprised by Hope](https://amzn.to/3LOJUHl))
- Ray Kurzweil (on the scientific side; see, for example, [The Singularity is Near](https://amzn.to/3LSGaVd)). 

### Ethical frameworks
Within the transhumanist movement, there are various articulated ethics, from:

- (1) Radical individualism
    - Seeking to elevate oneself above all others. 
    - A prime example of this ethic is Zoltan Istvan's "Transhumanist Wager".
- (2) Radical humanism
    - Seeking to elevate humanity together. 
    - Particularly by erasing disease, poverty, suffering, and extending human life and well-being. 
    - A prime example of this ethic is Humanity+, formerly the World Transhumanist Association.
- (3) Radical environmentalism
    - Seeking to elevate the entire biosphere. 
    - Particularly by bioengineering the elimination of animal suffering and predation.
    - (This often draws on biblical imagery, such as lions and lambs lying down together.)
    - A prime example of this is David Pearce, co-founder of the World Transhumanist Association.

In the above framework, Christian Transhumanism can thus be understood as:

- (4) Radical Christian mission
    - Seeking to pursue the ethical imperative of Christ and of God.
    - Particularly by healing diseases, feeding the hungry, clothing the naked; by extending human life and well-being; by elevating people together in compassion and trust.
    - This can entail both technological advocacy, and ethical advocacy.
    - A prime example of this is the Christian Transhumanist Association, and the larger Christian Transhumanist community.

### The Religious History of Transhumanism

__The 17th Century Scientific Revolution__

Key figures of the Scientific Revolution, like Francis Bacon, are often seen as originators or precursors of transhumanism. Bacon, like Robert Boyle, and other members of the Royal Society, believed that the pursuit of science and technology was a religious imperative, and that it should lead to the elimination of diseases and the radical extension of human life. Bacon's key work, "The New Organon" (1620), was in part a theological argument for scientific institutions. Bacon's influential work "The New Atlantis" (1627) was a fictional account of religious reform leading to scientific reform, leading to radical technological progress, life extension, virtual reality, and so on.

These scientific/theological viewpoints were incredibly sincere, influential, and formed in close dialogue with leading theologians of the time.

In short, Christian eschatological belief, as well as contemplation of the Creation Mandate of Genesis 1, and the consequences of the Fall, fostered the new empirical science. And that was explicitly formed in anticipation of radical longevity, biological transformation, and other elements of what would now be described as a transhumanist platform.

__Nikolai Fedorov (1829-1903) and the Russian Cosmists__

Fedorov was a devout Russian Orthodox Christian, who believed humanity was called by God to advance science and technology, in order to fulfill the Creation Mandate of Genesis 1. Fedorov believed this extended to the prospect of technological resurrection, which in turn would require space exploration. Fedorov's views are credited with inspiring a "Russian Cosmist" movement, that eventually helped build the Russian space program.

__Teilhard de Chardin (1881–1955), Jesuit priest and paleontologist__

Teilhard de Chardin sought to reconcile his faith and evolutionary science. The result was a vision that anticipated what we would now call the Internet and the Singularity. He coined the term "Omega Point", which has had a long and influential life beyond his work. He used terms such as "transhuman" and "transhumanity" for his future vision.

__WD Lighthall (1940)__

Lighthall was an evolutionary scientist, seeking to envision the future of life. In his 1940 essay, *The Law of Cosmic Evolutionary Adaptation*, Lighthall envisioned life reaching up beyond all current limits and understanding. He connected this with Dante's line "words cannot tell of that transhuman change", and what he called "Paul's transhumanism", quoting the New Testament.

__Julian Huxley (1887-1975)__

Huxley is often credited as the originator of modern transhumanism. He was a dialogue partner of Teilhard de Chardin, and wrote the forward to Teilhard's book The Phenomenon of Man. He explicitly sought to formulate a post-religion religion, as in his book *Religion without Revelation*. His 1957 essay *Transhumanism* defined the modern use of the term: man remaining man, yet transcending himself—and sought to launch the non-religious equivalent to Teilhard de Chardin's work.

__Frank Tipler (1947-)__

Frank Tipler is an accomplished physicist, whose 1994 book *The Physics of Immortality* articulated a religious transhumanist cosmology, named the "Omega Point Theory" in honor of Teilhard de Chardin.  

Tipler asked "What would it take for life to survive all the way to the end of time?", and his answer envisioned the universe becoming filled with life, which then guides the entire cosmos into a convergent point of infinite intelligence, power, and beauty. Tipler argues this Omega Point would not only be able to guarantee immortality to all those living, but to engineer the resurrection of all beings who have ever lived, raising them to glory and pleasure beyond our wildest imaginations.

Tipler's vision was endorsed by fellow physicist David Deutsch in *The Fabric of Reality*, who nevertheless disagreed with the religious interpretation of Tipler's vision, and remained an atheist.

Tipler's vision was influential in the (largely secular) 90s transhumanist movement.

Tipler's vision also inspired a number of young Christian Transhumanists, who would later form the Christian Transhumanist Association. This number includes Micah Redding and Neal Locke.

Tipler himself eventually converted to Catholicism, and is a staunch Christian Transhumanist.
