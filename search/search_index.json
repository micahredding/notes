We come by it via the Empiricism of Francis Bacon, who was deeply influential to Alexander Campbell and other early Restoration Movement leaders. The first Restoration Movement college was \"Bacon College\" in Kentucky.</p> <p>Significantly, Francis Bacon can be credited with many of the ideas that became definitive in the Restoration Movement. </p> <ol> <li> <p>The concept of a Restoration Movement itself shows up in one of Francis Bacon's most significant works\u2014\"The Great Instauration\" (1620). The title is a reference to the Restoration Movement he believed was predicted in scripture. </p> </li> <li> <p>Bacon believed this religious movement would be a precursor to the renewal of humanity's dominion\u2014a millennial age of both spiritual and scientific progress. This was a key concept for Alexander Campbell, likely inspiring his \"Millennial Harbinger\".</p> </li> <li> <p>Bacon believed that this Restoration would come about through the discovery of right liturgy\u2014the proper patterns of worship and service. In his \"New Atlantis\" (1627), he pictured a land full of scientific and technological achievement, centered around a renewed and righteous pattern of worship. This was precisely the vision Campbell had for America. </p> </li> <li> <p>Bacon believed this Restoration could only come about through the chastening of human tradition and leadership.</p> </li> <li> <p>Intertwined with all of this was a high anthropology. Bacon was an opponent of Calvinism, and drew deeply on the patristics, particularly via the Eastern tradition, to support that rejection. The Fall was not a total corruption, Bacon insisted. Two centuries later, Restoration Movement leaders would repeat a similar refrain.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Francis Bacon didn't derive his theological viewpoint from scratch. His mentor, Lancelot Andrewes, was a prominent bishop in the Church of England, overseeing the translation of the King James Bible. Andrewes was a student of the Eastern tradition, adopting the Eastern theory of atonement and salvation, over and against the Western tradition.</p> <p>So I think the Eastern tradition significantly shaped a certain segment of the Anglican Church, which formed the theology underlying Francis Bacon's Empirical Science, which in turn was foundational in shaping the Restoration Movement and the Churches of Christ.</p> <p>And I think that gave us several aspects of our DNA.</p> <p>From the Eastern tradition:</p> <ul> <li>A high anthropology \u2014 over and against Calvinism, and the Western tradition in general.</li> <li>A strong emphasis on right liturgy \u2014 as source of identity and cohesion.</li> <li>A relatively low emphasis on leadership figures. In the CoC, we typically call our most prominent public figures \"preachers\" (a liturgical function), not \"pastors\" (a leadership function).</li> </ul> <p>From Bacon's Anglicanism:</p> <ul> <li>A concept of Restoration</li> <li>A concept of the Millennium \u2014 now mostly absent, but core to Campbell and others</li> </ul> <p>Much of this influence has faded. But even today, I think some of that shared DNA is discernible. And I think, if we choose, we can fan that flame into life. The Church of Christ has always sat uneasily within Protestantism, just as the Anglican Church often has. </p> <p>Perhaps we can choose to be something else. </p> <p>Perhaps the Restoration Movement was always intended to reclaim a theological tradition that had been lost to the Western tradition as a whole. </p> <p>Perhaps we can become a source of revitalizing that tradition in the world today.</p> <ul> <li>Source \u2014 Church of Christ Theology</li> <li>Facebook Group \u2014 Churches of Christ and Eastern Orthodoxy</li> <li>Related \u2014 Sacrament &amp; Sacramentalism</li> </ul>"},{"location":"notes/Church%20of%20Christ/","title":"Church of Christ","text":"<ul> <li>Why I am a member of the Church of Christ</li> <li>Church of Christ &amp; Eastern Orthodoxy</li> </ul>"},{"location":"notes/Co-Creation%20in%20Scripture/","title":"Co-Creation with God in scripture","text":"<p>This is my basic framework for understanding this idea:</p> <ol> <li>Genesis 1 gives us the Creation Mandate, the calling to rule all things in imitation of God.

In more secular-leaning ceremonies, the emphasis is often on the power of the couple\u2019s love to hold them together. In Church of Christ ceremonies, the emphasis is often on the biblical example, or the command to stay together.</p> <p>I don\u2019t really like either of these. No relationship is perfect, and no two people are perfect. Yet without a larger reference, the secular wedding ultimately has to be a kind of \u201cworship service\u201d for the couple\u2019s love. On the other hand, biblical commands simply raise the stakes\u2014they don\u2019t help strengthen the relationship.</p> <p>I suspect these are both unhealthy for many people, including the couple who are now trying to live up to them.</p> <p>I suspect we\u2019re missing something, because we\u2019ve lost the idea of Marriage as a Sacrament.</p> <p>Instead of leaning on the couple to either obey the rules, or live up to our romantic ideals, I think we should let them lean into a story and a love that is bigger than they are.

Instead of giving biblical commands, examples, or instructions\u2014instead of simply praising their relationship\u2014I wanted to make the service a physical and emotional act of stepping into the divine life.</p> <p>Here's part of the service: </p> <p>My Sister's Wedding Ceremony</p> <ul> <li>Source \u2014 Church of Christ Theology</li> <li>Related \u2014  Church of Christ &amp; Eastern Orthodoxy</li> </ul>"},{"location":"notes/My%20Sister%27s%20Wedding%20Ceremony/","title":"My Sister's Wedding Ceremony","text":"<p>I was incredibly honored and thrilled to perform the wedding of my sister Hannah today. Here's a rough transcript of what I said during the ceremony.</p> <p>.</p> <p>We're gathered here today to celebrate the marriage of Hannah Marie Redding, and Juan Daniel Garza. We're gathered here as family and friends and loved ones to express our love for them, and our dreams and wishes and hopes for their future. I want to thank them for inviting us to be a part of this moment in their lives, and I want to thank you all for joining us in it.</p> <p>When I was trying to prepare for this moment, I wanted to look back across history to see what other people felt was important to say, to express, to affirm, in moments like this.</p> <p>And I was struck by a single idea: that over countless generations, people have come together in these kinds of ceremonies, in order to connect what they were feeling and sharing at that specific moment in time, with something bigger than they were.</p> <p>And so, I want to try to connect what we're celebrating and sharing and experiencing here today, with something that is bigger than us all.</p> <p>The Catholic writer GK Chesterton said that we like to say \"God is love\", because that sounds like a nice sentiment, but we don't like to say \"God is trinity\", because that sounds like religious dogma. The irony, as he expressed it, is that these are two different ways of saying exactly the same thing. And the reason we don't recognize this is because we've forgotten what love actually looks like.</p> <p>For Chesterton, the trinity isn't simply an abstract statement about the nature of God\u2014it's a model of the purest, and fullest, and most complete kind of love there is. And it's a model we're invited to embody in ourselves and in our relationships.</p> <p>I think the nature of this relationship can be expressed in one simple phrase:</p> <p>\"All that I have is yours.\"</p> <p>This phrase is found twice in the Gospels. The first time is in the story of the Prodigal Son, where the God character says it to his children. The moral of the story isn't simply that we may be forgiven and accepted, but that the one who forgives and accepts us is the one who says to us:</p> <p>\"You are always with me, and All that I have is yours.\"</p> <p>The second time we see this phrase, it's in the mouth of Jesus himself. This may be the most audacious claim Jesus makes in all of scripture\u2014when he turns to God, and says in essence:</p> <p>\"You are always with me, and All that I have is yours.\"</p> <p>This is the picture of a relationship where each person is devoted to lifting up the other, without end, without limit. In this kind of relationship, one can say to the other:</p> <p>\"I want to see you reach all that you are, all that you may be, all that you can become. I want to see the full expression of your beauty, glory, strength, and power. I want to see you rise without limit, without end. And I want to dedicate myself to helping make that happen.\"</p> <p>And the other can say in turn:</p> <p>\"I want to see you reach all that you are, all that you may be, all that you can become. I want to see the full expression of your beauty, glory, strength, and power. I want to see you rise without limit, without end. And I want to dedicate myself to helping make that happen.\"</p> <p>In this kind of relationship, there is no subjugation, no subordination. In this kind of relationship, no identity is erased, no desire is dissolved, no will is broken. In this kind of relationship, each one is only ever lifting, and being lifted.</p> <p>In this kind of relationship, there is no room for enabling or codependency. In this kind of relationship, there is no self-sacrifice that is not also a self-glorification. In this kind of relationship, there is only light, and no darkness at all.</p> <p>We're told that in this kind of relationship\u2014where each is seeking to help the other reach their unending and limitless potential\u2014that the relationship itself becomes its own substance, its own dynamic, its own power. And this is the kind of power that can give life to the world, call new things into existence, create and cultivate life, and bind the world together.</p> <p>This is the kind of relationship that constitutes the divine being, and it's the kind of relationship we're invited to model and embody in our own lives. And when we do so\u2014when we participate in this kind of relationship, and this kind of love, then scripture boldly declares that we become participants in the divine nature, partakers of the divine life.</p> <p>Of course, all of us only approximate this kind of love.</p> <p>Because this kind of love is difficult. You can never fully devote yourself to lifting up another person, until you trust that they are devoted to lifting up you as well.</p> <p>And so it's a process. A process of learning to trust the other person, to trust yourself, to become strong, as you become vulnerable. And so, step by step, a bit at a time, in growth, and discovery, and challenge, and change\u2014we move ever closer to the vision of divine life.</p> <p>And I think this is why generation after generation have held these kinds of ceremonies. To remind ourselves to step forward into this kind of relationship, this kind of reality, this kind of love.</p> <p>And to invite the couple to connect their relationship with this vision, this aim, this goal\u2014</p> <p>The kind of relationship, and the kind of love, that makes up the substance of divinity itself.</p> <p>Source: Facebook</p>"},{"location":"notes/Notes%20for%20Researchers%20on%20Christian%20Transhumanism/","title":"Notes for Researchers on Christian Transhumanism","text":""},{"location":"notes/Notes%20for%20Researchers%20on%20Christian%20Transhumanism/#definitions","title":"Definitions:","text":"<ul> <li>Transhumanism can be defined as the ethical use of science and technology to transform the human condition.</li> <li>Christian Transhumanism can be defined as the ethical use of science and technology to transform the human condition, as exemplified by discipleship of Christ.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"notes/Notes%20for%20Researchers%20on%20Christian%20Transhumanism/#scholars-whove-engaged-with-christian-transhumanism","title":"Scholars who've engaged with Christian Transhumanism:","text":"<ul> <li>Ron Cole-Turner</li> <li>Ted Peters</li> <li>Calvin Mercer</li> <li>J.

Bacon, like Robert Boyle, and other members of the Royal Society, believed that the pursuit of science and technology was a religious imperative, and that it should lead to the elimination of diseases and the radical extension of human life. Bacon's key work, \"The New Organon\" (1620), was in part a theological argument for scientific institutions. Bacon's influential work \"The New Atlantis\" (1627) was a fictional account of religious reform leading to scientific reform, leading to radical technological progress, life extension, virtual reality, and so on.</p> <p>These scientific/theological viewpoints were incredibly sincere, influential, and formed in close dialogue with leading theologians of the time.</p> <p>In short, Christian eschatological belief, as well as contemplation of the Creation Mandate of Genesis 1, and the consequences of the Fall, fostered the new empirical science. And that was explicitly formed in anticipation of radical longevity, biological transformation, and other elements of what would now be described as a transhumanist platform.</p> <p>Nikolai Fedorov (1829-1903) and the Russian Cosmists</p> <p>Fedorov was a devout Russian Orthodox Christian, who believed humanity was called by God to advance science and technology, in order to fulfill the Creation Mandate of Genesis 1. Fedorov believed this extended to the prospect of technological resurrection, which in turn would require space exploration. Fedorov's views are credited with inspiring a \"Russian Cosmist\" movement, that eventually helped build the Russian space program.</p> <p>Teilhard de Chardin (1881\u20131955), Jesuit priest and paleontologist</p> <p>Teilhard de Chardin sought to reconcile his faith and evolutionary science. The result was a vision that anticipated what we would now call the Internet and the Singularity. He coined the term \"Omega Point\", which has had a long and influential life beyond his work. He used terms such as \"transhuman\" and \"transhumanity\" for his future vision.</p> <p>WD Lighthall (1940)</p> <p>Lighthall was an evolutionary scientist, seeking to envision the future of life. In his 1940 essay, The Law of Cosmic Evolutionary Adaptation, Lighthall envisioned life reaching up beyond all current limits and understanding. He connected this with Dante's line \"words cannot tell of that transhuman change\", and what he called \"Paul's transhumanism\", quoting the New Testament.</p> <p>Julian Huxley (1887-1975)</p> <p>Huxley is often credited as the originator of modern transhumanism. He was a dialogue partner of Teilhard de Chardin, and wrote the forward to Teilhard's book The Phenomenon of Man. He explicitly sought to formulate a post-religion religion, as in his book Religion without Revelation. His 1957 essay Transhumanism defined the modern use of the term: man remaining man, yet transcending himself\u2014and sought to launch the non-religious equivalent to Teilhard de Chardin's work.</p> <p>Frank Tipler (1947-)</p> <p>Frank Tipler is an accomplished physicist, whose 1994 book The Physics of Immortality articulated a religious transhumanist cosmology, named the \"Omega Point Theory\" in honor of Teilhard de Chardin.  </p> <p>Tipler asked \"What would it take for life to survive all the way to the end of time?\", and his answer envisioned the universe becoming filled with life, which then guides the entire cosmos into a convergent point of infinite intelligence, power, and beauty. Tipler argues this Omega Point would not only be able to guarantee immortality to all those living, but to engineer the resurrection of all beings who have ever lived, raising them to glory and pleasure beyond our wildest imaginations.</p> <p>Micah Redding has summarized the Omega Point Theory here, and interviewed Tipler here.</p> <p>Tipler's vision was endorsed by fellow physicist David Deutsch in The Fabric of Reality, who nevertheless disagreed with the religious interpretation of Tipler's vision, and remained an atheist.</p> <p>Tipler's vision was influential in the (largely secular) 90s transhumanist movement.</p> <p>Tipler's vision also inspired a number of young Christian Transhumanists, who would later form the Christian Transhumanist Association.

Facebook, studies say, makes us unhappy by showing other people at their best. This makes us feel like our lives are worse than they are, and we become dissatisfied and unhappy.</p> <p>I\u2019m sure all this is true, and is a valid critique of our culture.</p> <p>But there are few times when I\u2019ve felt happier than when I had something big and ambitious to aspire to. In fact, one of my chief disappointments in growing older is that society hasn\u2019t risen to the challenge of giving me new things to base my aspirations on.</p> <p>Of course, the aspirations I picked up on weren\u2019t things like \u201chave a bigger house\u201d, or \u201cdrive a nicer car\u201d. They were more like, \u201cbe an epic swordsmen and start your own airline\u201d, or \u201cspeak twelve languages and go rock-climbing on the weekends\u201d.</p> <p>In fact, after being drawn in by all the aspirational lifestyles the magazines were selling, one of the first aspirations I actually ever developed for myself was to be a magazine publisher.</p> <p>These kinds of aspirations didn\u2019t leave me dissatisfied with my life. Instead, because I knew I could jump in and work towards them, they gave me meaning and purpose, a sense of open-ended possibility, and a pulsing creative energy. They didn\u2019t limit me to some predefined rat race; they showed me the doorway to greater and grander things than I had yet imagined.</p>"},{"location":"notes/posts/being-human/","title":"Being Human","text":"<p>It\u2019s very common to hear people re-iterate the fact that we are human.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m only human\u201d \u201cI\u2019m finally getting in touch with my own humanity\u201d \u201cThe inhuman treatment of prisoners\u2026\u201d</p> <p>But nailing down just what is being talked about is a little tricky. In philosophical and theological circles, human is often used as a synonym for limited. </p> <p>This, I think, is weak.</p> <p>Of course, it\u2019s true that we are limited. At any given moment, we have constraints on our action, and are forced to make choices between different outcomes, based on the energy and resources we have at our disposal. We are always making decisions under duress.</p> <p>But, to listen to mythology and theology, this is also the situation of the gods. It is the fate of all beings; divinity doesn\u2019t get a free pass.</p> <p>So what makes us human is not fundamentally a contrast with the divine. The contrast must be with something else, something much closer to home.</p> <p>This past month I\u2019ve been walking every morning. I spend a lot of time in a mental world \u2014 thinking, writing, coding \u2014 and walking makes me feel a little more in touch with aspects of myself that tend to fade from view. I enjoy the feeling of stretching my legs, venturing out into the world, taking on a little of the elements, experiencing the sense that I could keep going, that other places are within reach. It reconnects me to my trips overseas, to my childhood spent hiking through the woods.</p> <p>And I often summarize this by saying that it makes me feel more human. And by that, I mean that it makes me feel less one-dimensional.</p> <p>Being human, I think, is being nuanced. It is being complex and layered. It is having connections with our body, our selves, and the world around us. It is answering to hunger, and being compelled to write.</p> <p>This complex of nested relationships that we live in imposes a lot on us. It\u2019s easy to see that as being limited, or operating under constraints. But what it really is, I think, is an insistence that we don\u2019t live in just one area, defined by our jobs or our family or our thoughts. We live in a wide-open world, and we are beings built to be just as open, just as nuanced and nested and deep, as everything around us.</p>"},{"location":"notes/posts/believe-in-free-will/","title":"Why do we believe we have free will?","text":"<p>We believe it because we contain within ourselves a self-model, a self in miniature with which we observe and contemplate and predict our actions.

Christianity tells you to go on a road trip from which you will never return.\u201d</p> <p>When Jesus was asked about the greatest commandment, he responded by giving two great commandments: love God, love your neighbor. It\u2019s interesting to me how often Jesus replies to questions with non-sequiturs. When asked about who we should treat as our neighbors, Jesus instead offered a story on how to be a good neighbor to others.</p> <p>There\u2019s something there. In contrasting Buddhism and Christianity, I\u2019m not suggesting that they offer two different answers to the same question, so much as I am suggesting that Christianity skips the question altogether, and moves on to a different topic. Christianity fundamentally does not answer any questions about how to live your life, or how to build a better society. So many of the things essential to building society are simply ignored by the Christian scriptures: politics, raising children, to baptize infants or not (and thus our whole understanding of what it means to be baptized into Christianity), career-planning, marriage. Despite cursory discussions of those topics, the New Testament essentially ignores such deeply important things, and instead tells people to pave the way for the new order of things that was coming into being.</p> <p>I\u2019m starting to think this was no accident. Jesus didn\u2019t spend a lot of time pre-resurrection telling people what to expect after his resurrection. And the New Testament doesn\u2019t spend a lot of time telling people how to live in the new world that was going to be dominated by Christendom. All it does is provoke an event. All it does is tell people to let go of how things are, and be prepared to embrace how things will be.</p> <p>All it does is tell us to pack our bags, hit the road, and see what we find.</p> <p>Maybe that\u2019s the really provocative idea in Christianity: that we can trust ourselves enough to figure it out as we go. Maybe that\u2019s the significance of being led by the Spirit; not that we get some emotional warm-fuzzies, not that God audibly speaks to us, not that God has a purpose and plan for our life that gets revealed to us as we go \u2014 but that God trusts us enough to figure it out. That God is present with us as we do. That God\u2019s image in us is so pronounced, we don\u2019t need a roadmap for the journey.</p> <p>We just need to start. </p> <p>And that\u2019s exactly what the New Testament helps us do, over and over again. It tells us to drop our things, pick up our staff, and go. It tells us to head straight towards suffering and turmoil. It tells us to embrace life and chaos. It tells us to let go of what defines us. </p> <p>And it assures us that when we\u2019ve done so, we will soon find something new.</p>"},{"location":"notes/posts/here-be-dragons/","title":"Here be Dragons","text":"<p>\u201cHere be dragons\u201d was not superstitious babble, but a deep acknowledgement of unknown dangers, forces and factors beyond human control.

It means pursuing more health, fitness, intelligence, emotional depth, creativity, culture, spirituality, and empathy. It means seeking progress and growth along every dimension of human existence.</p> <p>Like everything else in life, there are practical components to this, and more abstract components. Both are necessary; the abstract components help us to choose our direction and focus, give us an over-arching storyline for framing our lives, and inspire us to greater efforts. The practical components, though, are necessary and easy to overlook.</p> <p>This has always been a problem; religion and philosophy have struggled with it forever. Ask any thoughtful theologian, and they will tell you that the significance of religion is in how it impacts human life. Otherwise, there would be no need for all of the time, energy, and effort invested in it. But even so, it's incredibly easy for religious abstractions intended to improve human life to become excuses for making life worse, or for disengaging from life entirely. This, I think, is the paradox inherent in all abstractions. Human life could not exist without abstraction, and yet abstraction can easily become destructive to that very life.</p> <p>So I\u2019d like to write a bit about the practical side of transhumanism. There is a serious constraint to this, however, and it\u2019s the same constraint that applies to every bit of self-help, self-improvement, and productivity advice out there: what works for one person may not work for another.</p> <p>So I\u2019m not going to write general advice or universal principles; I\u2019m going to write about my process, as I figure it out. That\u2019s all this will be, and that\u2019s the limit of what it applies to.

And near the end of that trip, we found ourselves in Cairo, Egypt, in the middle of Tahrir Square.</p> <p>I didn't, and don't, know much about Egyptian politics. But we were there in the aftermath of their revolution, after their first democratic election ever had been held, and the results had come back so close, there had to be a recount.</p> <p>For the entire week we were there, it was apparent that people were tense. This was a big deal, and everyone was talking about it. When the recount came in, would the winner be a representative of the tyrannical regime they had just ousted, or a people's candidate with dangerous political ties?</p> <p>We listened to these discussions the whole time we were there. And on the day we were flying out, we accidentally found ourselves back in Tahrir Square, packed with thousands upon thousands of people.</p> <p>We had come several times before. And each time, we were patted down by the volunteer civilian security force surrounding the premises. They asked for our IDs, they checked our pockets, and then they saw we were Americans and welcomed us in.</p> <p>It was intimidating. We were clearly out of place. Effigies were hanging from light posts, with nooses around their necks. There was a lot of noise. Once, we emerged from the wrong subway entrance, and came up behind a demonstrator speaking loudly to the crowd. The people around us were so pressed together, it took us a half-hour to move a few feet. It was night, and the square was full of music and speeches and people cheering and jeering and squeezing up against each other.</p> <p>So this time was shocking. Here we were in the middle of the square, and everyone was completely silent. This square full of people that had probably been making noise non-stop since the previous November, had now gone completely still, as radios at different points in the crowd read off numbers and votes.</p> <p>Of course, I couldn't understand what was being said. And so I waited in silence too, for over an hour, hoping to see how this would all resolve.</p> <p>The voice kept droning. But then I thought that perhaps someone in the crowd had stirred. And suddenly, everything around me exploded.</p> <p>People were laughing, crying, falling on the ground praying. Music burst forth, dancing, people with flags spinning in circles, tossing each other into the air.</p> <p>It was the most intense outpouring of emotion I had ever seen. It was impossible not to get caught up in it.</p> <p>And I just so happened to have caught that moment on video.</p> <p>The moment when these people went from expectation to realization, from never having experienced a democratic election in their lives, to having witnessed and been a part of a change in their country's history. This was a turning point, and I saw the switch of history get flipped before my eyes.</p> <p>And a minute into it, my phone came up and said \"unable to save video\". I had captured one of the most intense moments of my life, and just like that, it was gone.</p> <p>It occurred to me then, and later, that journalists were unseen during this event. But the real history was being recorded on hundreds of camera phones and pocket devices. The real history was recorded from the point of view of the people who were in it, who were living it.</p> <p>It used to be that history was the domain of the kings, the emperors, the business leaders, dictators, and politicians. But no more. Now we can see history from the point of view of the people to whom it mattered most.</p> <p>But something else occurred to me. A year later, how many of these recordings would still exist? How many phones would have broken, or been lost, or been upgraded without transferring these historic photos? How many people would simply not know how to preserve their photos or videos?</p> <p>We are recording a better history than we've ever had before. But we're losing it almost as fast.</p> <p>I realized that the creators of these technologies, like my phone, or the phones of the people around me, had never prioritized making sure that these kinds of historic records would last. So I could record a monumental video, and my iPhone could trash it with nothing more than a warning message. And these people could take historic photos, and simply lose them in a botched upgrade, or a dead battery.</p> <p>And I realized that I needed to change this. That our history is worth saving. That the individual vantage points of each of these people, and everyone else currently walking this earth at this moment, is a vast and unimaginably rich source of insight. That future generations will weep at the loss currently being caused by our carelessness.</p> <p>We're recording a better history than we've ever had before.
